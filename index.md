## Take it to heart. And then give it away.

By definition, **heart is the innermost or central part of anything.** It has spirit, courage and enthusiasm as well as the capacity for sympathy, feeling and affection.

*Heart 2015* marks the 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary as well as the last year for the *Calendar for Hope* and as every year past, it has been put together with great enthusiasm in preserving the memory of Christopher, as well as raising awareness about the importance of organ and tissue donation. A total of just over $25,000 from the sales of this project has been donated to the [Human Organ Procurement and Exchange (HOPE) Program][ahs] since 2006 and although the calendar comes to a close, art and design in memory of my brother will not. Although I'm not yet sure what 2016 and the new project in memory of Chris will bring, I promise you it will be delivered with as much heart, love and laughter as this calendar has been. 

As always, **100% of the proceeds are donated to the HOPE Program** so please buy a calendar (or five), sign your donor card and tell your loved ones your wishes. Once my heart is full of love and laughter and my time here is done, I will pay it forward along with every and any other tissue, bone, tendon and organ I can. 

Cheers! Jess Dupuis (n√©e Hogan), zando &amp; jot
