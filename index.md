## Chris had a heart for life

By definition, heart means a pleasurable appreciation of anything. My brother had a real heart for life. This is the 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the _calendar for hope_ and as every year past, it has been  put together with great pleasure in preserving the memory of Chris, as well as raising awareness about the importance of organ and tissue donation.

**Heart 2015 is a 5.5 x 8.5 inch calendar packed full of odd & strange illustrations by the creator of the _calendar for hope_, Jess Dupuis (née Hogan).** Jess donates her time, energy and award-winning talent to each illustration with the desire to raise awareness about the need for organ & tissue donation. Everyone can enjoy these conversation-starting pieces of art, so be sure to buy yours today.

## Heart history

This is the most rewarding design project I do and I thank you—my supporters, sponsors, clients, friends and families for your generosity and support. This calendar is successful because people like you make it so.

<p class="hilite">With your help, over $19,000 has been donated to the HOPE Program. The goal for 2015 is to increase that amount to over $24,000 with the sales of Heart 2015.</p>

The project began in 2005 when I created a small homemade calendar for family and friends. Entitled _Tonal 2006_, the calendar featured my art and I dedicated it in memory of Christopher.

Since 2006 I have been producing and selling this unique art-filled calendar to donate the proceeds to the University of Alberta’s [Human Organ Procurement and Exchange Program][ahs] to help raise awareness about the importance of becoming an organ & tissue donor. **So please buy a calendar (or 5 or 10) to share with your family and friends and sign your donor card!**

Cheers! Jess Dupuis (née Hogan), zando &amp; jot
